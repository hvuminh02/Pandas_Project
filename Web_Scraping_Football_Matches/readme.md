In this project, I'll  scrape football match data from the English Premier League.  

I'll download all of the matches for several seasons using Python and the requests library and then parse, clean the data using BeautifulSoup and pandas.  By the end, I'll have a single pandas DataFrame with all of the  EPL matches for multiple seasons.

In the next part of this project, I'll use the data I scraped to predict which side will win each match.
